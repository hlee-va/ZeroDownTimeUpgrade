# ZeroDownTimeUpgrade

For the example of super_http, use "./main &" to make it run as a daemon. Output can be found in runtime.log

Working on refactoring this to make the code cleaner and prettier. It's now just a POC demo and the code is a bit messy due to experiments.

Important Note: Stoppable Http Server will be supported offically by GoLang in 1.8. See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/4674#issuecomment-257161323 for more detail

However, the "Zero Downtime" part is still valuable.
